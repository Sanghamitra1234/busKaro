# busKaro
This is a website to book online bus tickets.This is our skill and hands-on project for 4th sem.
This website has internally two parts, one for admin and other for users. 
The users can search for the buses from location to destination, check the availablity. They can book seats and also has an online portal where they can visit their past histories of buses.
The admin or the bus conductors will have their own portal, they can udate the timing, availabilty of seats and state the price per seat in the website.
We have tried to add online payment system.
This has been hosted on the webhost : http://buskaro1.000webhostapp.com/
